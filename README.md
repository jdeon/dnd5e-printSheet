# Print sheet for D&D5e

The module adds a button at the top of player character sheet. This allows you to export the data of the character in a readable document. The document can be in html or in CSV, you can choose the export type in the module settings.

## Export Types

- [html (plain)](./doc/fvtt-Akra_(Dragonborn_Cleric).plain.pdf): better to print it on paper or in pdf. All fields are visible, and they are not interactive.
- [csv](./doc/fvtt-Akra_(Dragonborn_Cleric).csv.pdf): good to see data or to print.
- [html (accordion)](./doc/fvtt-Akra_(Dragonborn_Cleric).accordion.pdf): better way to keep it on mobile. It gives a clear document where field is clickable to give more details.
